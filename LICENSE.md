CREATIVE COMMONS LEGAL CODE
CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

### Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural, and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse, and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

### Copyright and Related Rights
A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. The right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
2. Moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
3. Publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
4. Rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work;
5. Rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use, and reuse of data in a Work;
6. Database rights (such as those under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996);
7. Other similar, equivalent, or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty.

### Waiver
To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably, and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims in the Work in:
(i) All territories worldwide,
(ii) For the maximum duration provided by applicable law,
(iii) In any current or future medium and for any number of copies,
(iv) For any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes.

The Waiver is for the benefit of each member of the public and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation.

### Public License Fallback
Should any part of the Waiver be legally invalid, Affirmer grants each affected person a royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable, and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work under the same terms as the Waiver.

### Limitations and Disclaimers
a. No trademark or patent rights are waived, abandoned, surrendered, or licensed under this document.  
b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work.  
c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work.  
d. Affirmer acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.
